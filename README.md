**uic-clock**

Tiny little but full-working icon-clock made with svg and js. This is perfect for adding it to a menue bar. The icon shows current time and can be configured to display an additional digital time with hours, minutes and seconds. Although the clock is svg, it adapts some font-css-styles such as size and color.

**uic-colorcube**

The uic-colorcube is a component that shows the colors of the  rgb-color-space in a 3-dimensional cube. The cube can be configured by element attributes and has a nice API to change the appearance of the cube with javascript, i. e to provide ui-elements as range-inputs.
